    <div>This exercise is about making lists</div>
    <div>This is what I like about lists:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
      <li>That's about it</li>
      <li>
        I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things in threes is
        cool
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div>When you make a list, do it in this order:</div>
    <ol>
      <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
      <li>If it's not an orderred list, use the ol tag</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use li tags mested in the list for your list items</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>
