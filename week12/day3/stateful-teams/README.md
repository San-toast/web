# Stateful Teams

These people need to be able to join a team! All of these students will have two team they can join.

- Team BC Crew
- Team Binary Bots

Your job is to implement state so that a student can join one team via a button. If they join one team, the button for that team must disappear and only show the opposing team. If they are not in a team, I should be able to see both teams as an option to join.

Implement an ability to reset the teams so that every starts back to their default state, where they were not on a team.
